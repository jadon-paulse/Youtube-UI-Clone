- Pages are always clear on what you can do them, like looking for your subscriptions and then going back to homepage where      recommended videos are showing.

- Youtube shows that you interacted with buttons or videos by showing a red bar at the top of the browser window to indicate its loading the page you wanted to navigate too.

- When the user looks at the icons on youtube they can tell what it does and where it takes you.

- The way to navigate through youtube is always clear on every page since it is in a spot where everyone can see it and is consistent.

- In youtube studio the user has a selection of options when uploading a video and editing some parts of it, the user always has an option to redo changes, preview the changes and  save it, this helps the user not feel forced to do everything in one go and instead have freedom of experimenting.
